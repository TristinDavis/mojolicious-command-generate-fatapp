fat-app version 0.01_5

FatApp is a Mojolicious applications generator, 
that generates more 'fat' application, then 'mojolicious generate app'.

FatApp adds base controller and model classes, defines json_config loader
and NOT defines any existing controller.

FatApp-generated skeleton is not ready to run as is. 
You should at least define one route, one controller and create config file.

Structure of newly created skeleton 'test': 

test
|- t
   |- basic.t

|- lib
   |- test.pm
   |- test
      |- Controller.pm
      |- Controller
      |- Model.pm
      |- Model

|- script
   |- test

|- templates
   |- not_found.html.ep
   |- exception.html.ep
   |- layouts
      |- default.html.ep

|- public
   |- js
   |- css
   |- img
